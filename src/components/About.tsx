        I'm a data scientist and developer specializing in machine learning, statistical analysis, and software development. My work focuses on transforming complex data into meaningful insights and building effective solutions.
        Outside of work, I'm an avid sports enthusiast. You can find me following Ajax football matches, playing tennis, improving my golf game, or kitesurfing when conditions are right. I also enjoy spending time woodworking, reading and listening to podcasts to unwind.
